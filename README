General
-------

Today's date is July 7, 2011. 

SACS is a class scheduler that uses instructor aversions and preferences to put
together a working schedule with a list of courses taken from a CSV file using 
rooms specified in a seperate CSV.  The structure of courses.csv allows classes
to be scheduled avoiding time slots for any other specified class, to be
scheduled or not, and of course avoid instructor blocks, where applicable.

The only dependencies I have knowingly introduced that shouldn't be too hard to 
eliminate are __popcnt64 from intrin.h and of course the inclusion of a few
functions taken from the publicly available Boost (1.46.1) libraries to aid in
multi-threading and random number generation.
